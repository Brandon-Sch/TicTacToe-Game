# TicTacToe Game

This is my take on the classic TicTacToe game. It is a two player game where you use the keys "q, w, e, a, s, d, z, x, c," to place your marker. 

The keys correspond as so: 

q   w   e

a s d

z x f

## Roadmap

- I would like to make it simplier to input the x's and o's and not have them correspond to a certain key.

- I am currently working on an ai to play against you so it can be one player.
